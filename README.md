# shell-config-squid
Hello! Sorry for my English, I do not speak well this language
I made this script to facilitate the work of all those who need to make the configuration of squid service.

### Important ###

To add locks , reduce speed, or even remove them, just follow the following paths

/etc/squid3/palavrasproibidas -> It makes the contents of blocking words

/etc/squid3/listabloqueada -> Block URL Sites

/etc/squid3/limite_20k -> reduces the speed of the Internet for selected IPÂ´s


This is a simple script , but I decided to share to help those who do not have time to do step by step configuration of squid

I hope it helps you, thanks
